NAME
    Package::Util - A Perl/XS implementation of package-related utilities

DESCRIPTION
    This module name is reserved for a dual Perl/XS module to access Perl
    internal functionality for package-related functions such as
    class-to-file path transformation, and various specific functionality
    relating to packages, modules, classes and %INC.

    The implementation is proposed for completion and inclusion in the core
    for the release of 5.10.

    This module was originally planned for implementation as Module::Util,
    but unfortunately that name was subsequently taken (hence the blatant
    land grab for this name).
